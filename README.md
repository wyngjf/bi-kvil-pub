## Installation

If conda is not yet available on your computer, 
install [Miniconda, e.g., for python 3.10](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers). 
To run the downloaded script, you may need to enable its execution using `chmod u+x ~/Downloads/Miniconda[...].sh`. 
After the installation, you can disable the auto-activation of the default "base" environment, as described in the installer output.

Get and run the installation script for kvil. If you modify the paths, be aware to either add or leave out the concluding slash (`/`) dependent on how the default path is defined.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wyngjf/bi-kvil-pub/main/scripts/kvil_install.sh
source kvil_install.sh
```
